* Description
  This script parses =Safari/Bookmarks.plist= to extract all URLs saved into the =ReadingList=
  by a user. All extracted URLs are sent to =add@getpocket.com= (see [[https://help.getpocket.com/article/895-how-to-save-to-pocket-overview][this]] guide from Pocket),
  which imports them automagically to user's account.
* Dependencies
  Your system should have at least =python2.7= installed. With that in place just run:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell -i
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  #+END_SRC
  On top of that a user must provide an SMTP server to use (as well as a key/password).
  GMail requires creating an extra =app= and generates a =password= that has to be used together with
  =smtp.gmail.com=. See [[https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en][this]] guide.
* Usage
  To upload *all* your ReadingList URLs run:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell -i
  python rl2pocket.py <email> <password> <smtp server>
  #+END_SRC
  Run:
  #+BEGIN_SRC -i
  python rl2pocket.py -h
  #+END_SRC
  to discover more.
